Sample saving program to help know how much to save each day and what the total savings should be. 

Day 1 saving £0.01 total savings = £0.01
Day 2 saving £0.02 total savings = £0.03
Day 3 saving £0.03 total savings = £0.06
etc... 

Day 100 would be saving £1.00 with total savings = £50.50 

At the end of the year on day 365 the saving for the day would be £3.65 and total saving amount would be £667.95
